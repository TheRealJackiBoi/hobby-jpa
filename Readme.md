## Collaboration
Our group have used GitHub and GitHub Projects to collaborate. We have created all of the user stories in the project kan-ban board, and then distributed the different tasks between us. Then we have been able to see if a task if someone was working on a specific task, or if it was done, or not started yet. This made it easy to find out what had to be done and get the full overview of the project.__

To make the collaboration easier, we implemented a rule on our main branch, such that it wasn't possible to pull into it, without having a pull request accepted by another member of the group.
